# MyFirstWebProject
Learning how to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, PHP and Google APIs, all in one project! Some notes:
- In order to run all the examples, have an apache-php+AJAX enabled server with the proper
permissions for the files (products.xml needs write permissions for the exercise No4).
- Click [here](http://bblodfon.github.io/MyFirstWebProject/1st_Web_assignment.html) to see the project/exercises online - note that exercise No 4 needs a server-side working also, which the github hosting does not provide.
