# myFirstWebApp
Learning how to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, PHP and Google APIs, all in one project! Some notes:
- In order to run all the examples, have an apache-php+AJAX enabled server with the proper
permissions for the files (products.xml needs write permissions for the exercise No 4 - A Product Catalog).
- Click [here](http://bblodfon.github.io/myFirstWebApp/1st_Web_assignment.html) to see the project/exercises online - note that exercise No 4 has some features that need a server-side also working, which the github hosting does not provide.
