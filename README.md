# femtoPowerControl
My NTUA thesis code

This code is very flexible in terms that it randomly create FAPS (Femto Access Points) inside a Macrocell (as 
many as you want!) and lets you choose the number of macro-users (also randomly placed inside the Macro-cell). 
Also, it lets you choose the number of Non-Real-Time macro-users (data users - need high data rate services - 2.4 Mbps).
Subsequently, the rest of the macro-users are Real-Time users (voice users mostly - data rate of 64Kbps).
Each FAP has one Real-Time user and one Non-Real-Time by default.

Then, the John Nash equilibrium algorithm which is implemented, finds the equilibirum powers of all the the users
(voice/data - femto and macro-users) and creates the necessary graphs such as the topology of the mobile network, 
the power vs iterations (it' s the 'k' in the code) needed to achieve the quilibrium, the data Rates achieved as 
well as the utilites of every user (starting from the macro to the femto users).

See the zompolas_femtopowercontrol pdf for a full explanation of what i did in my thesis.

The femtopowercontrol.m was tested in Matlab (version:R2011a). Run: >> femtopower
